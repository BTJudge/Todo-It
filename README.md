# Todo-It
[See it here](https://btjudge.github.io/Todo-It/)

A todo list app built while following the [watchandcode.com](http://watchandcode.com) tutorial. Further extended using localstorage and styles written in SASS.

Thoughts: Currently, the app redraws the entire list of todos after any change. Ideally, it would modify specific DOM elements appropriately, however, due to the number of todos likely appearing in the app, it'll remain this way.
