# Todo-It
A todo list app built while following the watchandcode.com tutorial. Further extended using localstorage and stlyes written in SASS.
Currently, the app redraws the entire list of todos on any change. Ideally, it would just modify the DOM appropriately, however, due to the number of todos likely appearing in the app, it'll remain this way.

Inspiration took from todomvc.com.
